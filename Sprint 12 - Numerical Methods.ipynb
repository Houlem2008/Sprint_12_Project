However, not training with the validation or test sets in the features also seems less than ideal as we're scaling data then applying that scaling to an entirely different set.

    "It's great that you tried different models, tuned their hyperparameters and measured the time it takes to train and evaluate the model. There is one problem though: you used the train set scores to tune hyperparameters, which makes no sense. Train set score tells us nothing about how well the model generalizes to new data, only how well it memorized the train set. We can't use the test set either, as it is used to evaluate the final model. There are two options: use a separate validation set or use cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning\n",

    "Using the *Linear Regression* model as our sanity check - the baseline for our RMSE is rounded to `3268.4` on the test data, and training time of 20.9 seconds on average with a model evaluation time of 200 milliseconds on average. The best performing non-gradiant boosted model, with extensive time spent tuning hyperparameters, was the *Random Forest Regressor* model resulting in a rounded RMSE of `1763.7` on the test data, with an average training time of 2 minutes 13 seconds and average evaluation time of 2.77 seconds of average. The *Decision Tree Regressor* model with a rounded RMSE of `2124.4` on the test data, an average training time of 8.06 seconds, and average evaluation time of 115 milliseconds, represented a faster model than the previous two but scored worse than the Random Forest Regressor.\n",

    "The gradiant boosted models we created resulted in the best choice when accuracy and processing time is taken into consideration. The *Gradiant Boost Decision Tree* model utilizing the Light GBM library, which resulted in a rounded RMSE of `1740.3` on the test data, average training time of 8.008 seconds, and and an average evaluation time of 1.03 seconds. The CatBoost Regressor, which resulted in a rounded RMSE of `1829.6` on the test data, with average training time of 6.51 seconds, and average evaluation time of 47.4 milliseconds. The gradiant boosted models are the ideal candidates for use - the decision would depend on whether accuracy or speed was the greater desire, though the Gradiant Boost Decision Tree model utilizing the LightGBM library isn't much slower than the CatBoost Regressor model with greater accuracy overall."
